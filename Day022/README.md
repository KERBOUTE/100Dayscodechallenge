Hello, the problem of the day 020, is a problem recently posed by facebook:

program to calculate sum of digits using input arrays containing digits of numbers
IDEA: logic is to iterate through last index of both arrays simulataneously calculating sum and also maintaining carry while adding it to previous indices of both arrays.
so, we need to maintain two variables one for answer of sum and other for carry, here we are using answer(sum) as a list so we can append each digit one by one
so, first sum of all digits till smaller arrays and then after that only adding carry and remaining digits of remaining array(bigger one)

function to calculate sum of digits of both arrays after ensuring that first array is always bigger in size than the other one
