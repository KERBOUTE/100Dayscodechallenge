Hello, the problem of the day 020, is a problem recently posed by twitter:

arr = [2, 0, 1, 0]
ptr -> pointing to the first index, as
i = 0 => hop 2 position => ptr at i = 1, then hop 1 position , ptr = > at i = 3 so, correct !
i = 1 => hop 0 position ...
i = 1 => hop 1 position => ptr at i = 3, so correct !

so, for every i, we are using ptr to hop to forward and check if it reaches the end !

this takes 0(N^2) in worst case
can we do better ?
