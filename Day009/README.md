Hello, the problem of the day 002, is a problem recently posed by Facebook:

Given a list of numbers, where every number shows up twice except for one number, find that one number.

```
Example:
Input: [4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 1

```
Here's the function signature:
```
def singleNumber(nums):
  # Fill this in.

print singleNumber([4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2])
# 1
```
Challenge: Find a way to do this using O(1) memory.
