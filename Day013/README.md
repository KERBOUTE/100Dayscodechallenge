Hello, the problem of the day 013, is a problem recently posed by LinkedIn:


You are given a positive integer N which represents the number of steps in a staircase. You can either climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Write a function that returns the number of unique ways to climb the stairs.

```
def staircase(n):
  # Fill this in.
  
print staircase(4)
# 5
print staircase(5)
# 8
```
Can you find a solution in O(n) time?
