Hello, the problem of the day 023, is a problem recently posed by Amazon:


Let's represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number. 
The nodes make up the number in reversed order.

For example, the following linked list:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
is the number 54321.

Given two linked lists in this format, return their sum in the same linked list format.
For example, given
9 -> 9
5 -> 2
return 124 (99 + 25) as:
4 -> 2 -> 1
