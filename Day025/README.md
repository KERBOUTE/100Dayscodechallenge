Hello, the problem of the day 025, is a problem recently posed by Netflix:

program to shift strings according to given shift matrix containing direction and steps needed to shift
0 means shift left, 1 means right shift and first index of each row of matrix gives direction
and second index gives steps
since the constrains are small, so 0(n*n) can be passed here.
