Hello, the problem of the day 034, is a problem recently posed by Twitter:

Program for vertical level traversal for the binary tree.
Nodes appearing in the same lines should be printed in level wise.

```
#          (0)      1
#                  / \
#          (-1)  2    3  (1)
#              / \   /  \
#        (-2) 4   5(0)6   7 (2)
#                   \    \
#                (1) 8    9   (3)
#
```

4 2 1 5 6 3 8 7 9
###### TIME : 0(N*log(N)), SPACE : 0(N)
It can be brought down to 0(N) if we data structure Map which supports inbuilt sorting based on keys.
